        dishChefNotes:
          "A twist on the beloved British favorite, delightfully simple and absolutely delicious for breakfast, brunch, lunch, or even dinner.",
        dishIngredients: [
          `1 1/2 pounds (about 8) small red potatoes`,
          `3 slices (about 4 ounces) thick cut bacon, diced`,
          `2 medium (3/4 pound) red onions, diced`,
          `2 tablespoons white wine vinegar`,
          `1 cup chicken broth (store-bought or homemade)`,
          `1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard`,
          `1/4 teaspoon salt`,
          `1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper`,
          `13 cup chopped fresh herbs (I like chives & parsley)`,
        ],
        dishRecipe: [
          `Peel the potatoes. Fill a pot with an inch or two of water and set a steamer basket inside. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Rinse the potatoes and place them in the steamer basket. Steam the potatoes, covered, for 20 minutes. To test for doneness, use a paring knife to pierce one of the potatoes; steam for a few more minutes if not quite done. Remove the steamer basket from the pot and let the potatoes cool for 20 minutes.`,
          `While the potatoes are cooling, make the bacon dressing: In a large skillet over medium heat, sauté the bacon until it begins to render some of its fat, ~5 min. (For crispier bacon, cook ~8 min.) Add the onions and sauté for 5 more mins, until the onions are softened and translucent, and the bacon is cooked through. Add the vinegar to the skillet. Stir it in with the onions and bacon and let it reduce, about 2 min. Stir in the chicken broth, mustard, salt, and pepper, and turn off the heat. Slice the cooled potatoes about 14 inch thick.`,
          `Stir the potatoes and herbs into the warm dressing. Stir until the potatoes are coated evenly. Enjoy!`,
